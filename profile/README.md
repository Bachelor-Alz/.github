# Health Monitoring System

This GitHub organization hosts the repositories for a **Health Monitoring System** designed for elderly care.

## About the Project

The **Health Monitoring System** is an **Arduino-based** health tracking solution that predicts **health risks for elderly individuals** and provides **direct notifications to caregivers**.

This project is developed by students at **Aalborg University** as part of a **bachelor project** for the **BSc in Software Engineering**.

## System Overview

The system consists of a **wearable health monitoring device** that collects **real-time sensor data** and sends it to an external server for **AI-based health risk prediction**. The data is then processed and displayed on a **mobile application** for caregivers, ensuring timely alerts in case of detected risks.
